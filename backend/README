for settring up backend for angular, 
Create a backend folder
-npm init -y, npm install typescript
-add a new tsconfig.json file and paste the code there
-create a src folder inside backed folder
-create a gitignore file inside backend folder and add node-modules there
-add the data to the backednd inside src -> data.ts and define any at this point necause we need dofferent configs for the data types in backend
-npm install express cors
-creating server.ts file inside src folder -> server.ts
-npm i --save-dev @types/express
-npm i @types/cors
tell cors to accept the request from my localhost 4200
-npm install ts-node --save-dev
--npm install nodemon --save-dev

now in package.json(backend), add start script inside script -> "start": "cd src && nodemon server.ts",

this is basics to start backend
